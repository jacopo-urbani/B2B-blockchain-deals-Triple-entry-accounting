# B2B-blockchain-deals-Triple-entry-accounting

The aim of this study is to explore how blockchain could affect the accounting and auditing profession by examining the potential use of blockchain technology in business-to-business purchasing transactions. Blockchain as a technology has the potential to disrupt business deals (Erica Pimentel et al., 2020: 326). Its immutability and timestamping allow disintermediation, a transparency increase, and real-time auditing. Furthermore, this technology enabled Triple-entry accounting to emerge (C. W. Cai, 2019, 71). The latter has the potential to modify a cornerstone of classic accounting: double-entry accounting. This paper analyses what it is, what changes from the current system, and additional features which add value to the system. This system could automate most of the current time-consuming and costly activities auditors carry out nowadays (C. W. Cai, 2019, 72). This study describes the basics of blockchain technology and the most important steps of current purchasing transaction and develops a practical case study of a realistic blockchain-based accounting transaction using Python. I analyze the most recent and relevant literature on blockchain and auditing and describe some practical examples, such as smart contracts or source of companies working in such sector
