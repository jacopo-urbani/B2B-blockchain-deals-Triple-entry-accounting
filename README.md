# B2B-blockchain-deals-Triple-entry-accounting

The aim of this study is to explore how blockchain could affect the accounting and auditing profession by examining business-to-business purchasing transactions. Therefore, the blockchain as a technology has the potential to disrupt business deals. Its immutability and timestamping allow disintermediation, a transparency increase, and real-time auditing. Furthermore, this technology enabled Triple-entry accounting to emerge. The latter has the potential to modify a cornerstone of classic accounting: pacioliâ€™s double-entry accounting. The paper analyzes what it is, what changes from the current system, and additional features which add value to the system. This system could automatize most of the current time-consuming and costly activities auditors carry out nowadays. To achieve the aim of the study, a descriptive approach was adopted to examine the basics of blockchain technology and the most important steps of current purchasing transaction, while a practical approach was assumed to define advantages of blockchain-based system through a python project. For that purpose, the most recent and relevant literature on blockchain and auditing was reviewed and some practical examples, such as smart contracts or source of companies working in such sector, were analyzed. As a result, the paper focuses on one single aspect of this area with the awareness that many fundamental concepts have been ignored
